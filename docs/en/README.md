# 🚀 Proxmox Extended Sensors

## Introduction

**Proxmox Extended Sensors is an integration for Home Assistant designed to provide advanced monitoring and complete control of Proxmox VE and Proxmox Backup Server (PBS).**

Unlike solutions based solely on metrics, this integration introduces an approach centered on **useful information (insight)**, allowing you to understand not only what is happening in the system, but also how it is actually performing.

It provides complete visibility of the infrastructure and adds direct control capabilities over nodes, virtual machines, containers, storage, and backup services.

---

## 🧠 System Insight (V3/V4)

Starting from version 3, the integration evolved from a collection of technical metrics to an infrastructure-oriented observability system.

V4 introduces sensors capable of interpreting the global state of the node and transforming complex metrics into useful and actionable information:

- **Proxmox Node** → global node state (`Excellent`, `Warning`, `Critical`, etc.) with enriched infrastructure attributes
- **Node Score** → numerical evaluation of system performance and overall health
- **Load Average (1m / 5m / 15m)** → actual host load
- **IO Wait** → detection of disk pressure and saturation
- **CPU usage per core** → available for nodes, VMs and containers
- **Node network telemetry** → intelligent calculation of aggregated RX/TX traffic from VMs and CTs
- **Advanced storage information** → status, capacity and detailed metrics of physical disks and storages

These sensors make it possible to detect bottlenecks, identify system degradation and build much smarter automations without the need for additional external tools.
